# SummarizeIT
This extension uses OpenAI's GPT-3 Model to summarize the data, terms, and conditions of the active website you're on. The information outputted from the API call might not accurate or correct. It's important to do your own research and thoroughly read through the terms and services of any site you are on if you are concerned.

# How to use SummarizeIT
This extension is still being worked on. It's completely functional to use in the developer mode. Keep in mind that every API call costs a few cents so OpenAI will charge you if you exceed their token limit. 

## Step One
Download the files from the repository

## Step Two
Create your API Key through https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and paste your API Key into the popup.js file

## Step Three
Turn on the chrome developer mode, load the extension, and you're set!
